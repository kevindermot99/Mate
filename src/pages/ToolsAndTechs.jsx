            I built QuoteMate to share a little bit of inspiration with every
            click. Itâ€™s a simple, lightweight app that pulls random quotes from
            the Rapid Quotes API, designed with a focus on ease and enjoyment.
            My goal was to create something quick, reliable, and fun to use,
            giving you and others a motivation to brighten your day.
            <br /> <br />
            Simply Made with:
          </p>
          {/* Markup list */}
          <MList
            list={[
